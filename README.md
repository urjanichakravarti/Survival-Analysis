# Survival Analysis 

## Objective
Survival Analysis is a branch of statistics for analyzing the expected duration of time until one event occurs. This event could be anything, like the death of a person, loss of a customer, failure of a course, and  failure in mechanical systems. 
In this project, we have extended the applications of Survival Analysis in the education and healthcare industries. 

**Education Problem Statement:**  To predict whether a student will withdraw from a course or university based on past/present behavior or other parameters. Identifying these factors can help us to prevent students from withdrawing from courses. 

**Healthcare Problem Statement:** To analyze and predict the effect a certain medicine/parameter has on the patient's survival rate. This can help us to reduce patient mortality.
